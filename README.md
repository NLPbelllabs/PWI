This repository contains code for the paper "<b>What Features of Tags Strengthen Vision-Language Alignment? Broader Understanding from Semantic-, Phonological- and Bilingualism-Relatedness</b>"

We adopt [VisualBERT](https://github.com/uclanlp/visualbert) to investigate tags' functionality from the perspective of semantic-, phonological- and bilingual-relatedness, where the original tag of the input triple is replaced by a word with various features to probe its influence on VQA task performance.
